## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the guidelines and expectations for remote work arrangements at Meridian AI Systems. It applies to all full-time employees across engineering, product, sales, and operations teams. Contractors and temporary staff should refer to their engagement agreements for remote work provisions.

## 2. Eligibility

All full-time employees who have completed their 90-day probationary period are eligible to request remote work arrangements. Eligibility is subject to role requirements, team needs, and performance standing. Employees on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) are not eligible for new remote work arrangements until the PIP is successfully completed.

## 3. Hybrid Remote Work (Standard)

Employees may work remotely up to **3 days per week** with direct manager approval. The following conditions apply:

- The employee must be available during **core hours: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM** in their designated time zone
- At least **2 days per week** must be spent in the office for team collaboration, unless the employee's nearest office is more than 50 miles from their residence
- Remote days should be consistent week-to-week and agreed upon with the manager
- Managers may require in-office attendance for specific meetings, team events, or project milestones with at least 48 hours' notice
- Remote work schedules must be entered in the PeopleHub HR system by the first Monday of each month

## 4. Fully Remote Arrangements

Fully remote work (5 days/week from a home office) requires:

1. **VP-level approval** from the employee's department head
2. A completed **Home Office Safety Inspection** conducted by the Facilities team (virtual inspection via video call is acceptable for employees outside a 100-mile radius)
3. Minimum **1 year of tenure** at Meridian AI Systems
4. A performance rating of **"Meets Expectations" or above** in the most recent review cycle
5. Written acknowledgment of the Remote Work Agreement, including data security obligations

Fully remote employees must visit their assigned office at least **once per quarter** for team offsites and planning sessions. Travel expenses for these visits are reimbursed per the Travel & Expense Policy.

## 5. Equipment and Stipends

### One-Time Home Office Stipend
All approved remote workers receive a **$1,500 one-time stipend** for home office setup. This covers:
- Ergonomic desk and chair
- External monitor
- Keyboard, mouse, and accessories
- Lighting and webcam

Purchases must be made within 60 days of remote work approval and receipts submitted through Expensify.

### Monthly Internet Reimbursement
Remote employees receive **$75/month** for internet service, applied automatically to payroll. No receipt submission is required. This benefit applies to both hybrid and fully remote employees.

### Company-Issued Equipment
All remote employees are issued:
- Company laptop (refreshed every 3 years)
- YubiKey hardware security token
- Encrypted USB drive for offline backups (engineering roles only)

Company equipment must be returned within 5 business days of employment termination.

## 6. International Remote Work

Meridian AI Systems does **not** currently support permanent international remote work due to tax, compliance, and data residency requirements. Temporary international remote work is permitted under these conditions:

- Maximum **30 calendar days per year** outside the employee's home country
- Prior written approval from both the direct manager and the Legal team (minimum 2 weeks' notice)
- The destination country must **not** be on the OFAC sanctions list or the company's restricted countries list
- VPN must remain active at all times when working internationally
- Access to production systems (AWS, database consoles, admin panels) is **blocked** from non-approved countries via geo-IP restrictions
- Employees are responsible for their own visa and work authorization compliance

## 7. Security Requirements

All remote workspaces must meet the following security standards:

- **Full-disk encryption** enabled on all devices (FileVault for macOS, BitLocker for Windows)
- **VPN connection** required when accessing internal systems, code repositories, or customer data
- Screens must be **locked when unattended** (auto-lock after 5 minutes maximum)
- Work must not be performed on **public Wi-Fi** without VPN; use of personal hotspot is recommended as a fallback
- **Confidential conversations** (customer calls, incident response) must not take place in public spaces
- Home Wi-Fi networks must use **WPA3 or WPA2** encryption with a strong password (minimum 12 characters)

## 8. Performance and Accountability

Remote employees are held to the same performance standards as in-office employees. Managers will:

- Conduct **weekly 1:1 check-ins** (minimum 30 minutes)
- Use objective, output-based metrics to evaluate performance
- Review remote work arrangements during semi-annual performance reviews
- Reserve the right to require increased in-office presence if performance declines

## 9. Revocation

Remote work privileges may be revoked with 2 weeks' written notice if:

- Performance falls below expectations
- Security violations are documented
- Business needs require in-office presence
- The employee fails to maintain required equipment or connectivity standards

Appeals may be submitted to the People Operations team within 5 business days of revocation notice.
